<p>A symbolic manipulation library is indispensable for scientists and students. Ruby is gaining huge popularity over the years, and a symbolic manipulation library gem  like this project in Ruby might prove to be the foundation for a computer algebra system in Ruby. With many efforts like these, Ruby might become the first choice for academicians given how easy it is to code your logic in Ruby.</p>

<p>The motivation for <a href="https://github.com/sympy/symengine">SymEngine</a> itself was to develop it once and then extend it to other languages rather than doing the same thing all over again for a language that it is required in.</p>

<p>I have developed a <a href="https://github.com/sympy/symengine/tree/master/symengine/ruby/notebooks">few notebooks</a> that demonstrate the use of the new SymEngine module in ruby. In the rest of the post, I would like to summarise what I did in the summer as part of <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google Summer of Code 2015</a>.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="pre-midterm-evaluations">Pre-midterm Evaluations</h2>

<p>I am a newbie when it comes to ruby, and it took me a while to setup the gem and, configure files for the building of extensions. I followed the naming conventions for the project structure and the extensions, as best as I could.</p>

<h3 id="the-struggle-between-shared-static-and-dynamic-libraries">The struggle between shared, static and dynamic libraries</h3>
<p>I faced a lot of problem in the early stages, when I was trying to build the extensions. <a href="https://github.com/certik">Ondrej</a>, my mentor, and <a href="https://github.com/isuruf">Isuru</a>, a fellow GSoC student, helped me a lot. There were many c flags that were being reported as missing. Some flags <code>cmake</code> added by default but <code>extconf.rb</code> didn’t, the same one that was required to be added to build it as a shared library. I am still confused about the details, more details are <a href="http://abinashmeher999.github.io/2015/05/29/Building-the-wrappers/">here</a>. Finally, the library had to be built as a dynamic one. It was resolved later by hooking the process to <code>cmake</code> rather than <code>mkmf</code>.</p>

<h3 id="load-errors-and-problems-in-linking">Load Errors and problems in linking</h3>
<p>Many <a href="http://abinashmeher999.github.io/2015/06/12/The-Load-Error/"><code>LoadError</code>s</a> popped up, but were eventually solved. <a href="https://github.com/dilcom/">Ivan</a> helped a lot in debugging the errors. In the end, it turned out to be a simple file missing in the gemspec, that was not being installed.</p>

<h3 id="reconfiguring-building">Reconfiguring building</h3>
<p>One of our aims during developing this was to get rid of unessential dependencies. The ones we already had the tools for. Like later the file <code>extconf.rb</code>, that is used to generate Makefile for the extension was removed, because that could also be done by <code>cmake</code>. Flags were added to <code>cmake</code> for building the Ruby extensions, like the flag <code>-DWITH_RUBY=yes</code>. The <code>Makefile</code> then generates the library <code>symengine.so</code> in the directory <code>lib/symengine</code>.Along with <code>extconf.rb</code>, the file <code>extconf.h</code> was also gone. Along these lines, the dependency on <code>rake</code> was also removed, and with that the <code>Rakefile</code>. Any task automation will most probably be done in python. So, the <code>Rake::ExtensionTask</code> was done by <code>cmake</code> and the <code>Rake::GemPackageTask</code> was replaced by the manual method of <code>gem build symengine.gemspec</code> and <code>gem install symengine-0.0.0.gem</code></p>

<h3 id="travis-setup">Travis setup</h3>
<p>Not many projects have travis-ci setup for multiple languages. Not even the tutorials had clearly mentioned about setting up for multiple languages. But I did know about one of them, which is Shogun, the machine-learning toolbox. I referred to their <code>.travis.yml</code> and setup it up. If something like this wouldn’t have worked the plan was to manually install the required version of ruby and then execute the shell commands.</p>

<h3 id="making-a-basic-object">Making a basic object</h3>
<p>Finally, I was able to successfully build the extensions, link the extensions with the SymEngine library, load the ruby-extension library in the interpreter and successfully instantiate an object of type <code>Basic</code>.</p>

<h3 id="inheritance-and-symbols">Inheritance and Symbols</h3>
<p>At this time, the way inheritance works(like the sequence of formation and destruction of objects of a class that had a superclass) with the Ruby C API, was confusing for all of us. I designed an <a href="http://abinashmeher999.github.io/2015/06/26/the-symbol-class/#inheritance-in-ruby-c-api">experiment</a>
to check what was actually happening. That cleared things out, and made the it easier to wrap things from now on. I also wrapped the <code>Symbol</code> class during the course.</p>

<h2 id="post-midterm-evaluations">Post-midterm Evaluations</h2>

<h3 id="redesign-of-the-c-interface">Redesign of the C interface</h3>
<p>We had to design an ugly function to wrap vector in C. That led us to redesign the C interface. This approach had no reinterpret casting that was being done earlier. Each data structure had a type that was determined at compile time. For C, it was an opaque structure, while for C++ the opaque structure declared in the shared header file was implemented in the source file that had C++ data types. This <a href="http://abinashmeher999.github.io/2015/07/03/improving-the-c-interface/">blog post</a> explains it further.</p>

<h3 id="integer-and-rational">Integer and Rational</h3>
<p>While trying to port the SymEngine classes, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Rational</code>, I had to port many methods in <code>Basic</code> before that. I also replicated the <code>rake</code> tasks in NMatrix, for detection of memory leaks, in form of bash scripts.</p>

<h3 id="common-enumeration">Common enumeration</h3>
<p>Since all objects in the Ruby C API are of the type <code>CBasic</code>, we needed a function that would give us the typename during the runtime for the corresponding objects to be wrapped in ruby, as an object of the correct <code>Class</code> in ruby. Since, this was achieved with <code>enum</code> in C++, the same thing could be done in C too, with all the classes written manually again. But there was no guarantee for this to be consistent, if ever the features required to be wrapped for a new language, and also manually adding the class in all the enum list everytime a new class is added was prone to errors. So, to make this DRY, we automated this by sharing the list of enums. More details for the implementation can be found <a href="http://abinashmeher999.github.io/2015/07/17/common-enumeration-in-c-and-c++/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="class-coercion-and-interoperability">Class coercion and interoperability</h3>
<p>To support interoperability with the builtin ruby types, I had to overload the methods in builtin classes earlier(this was not continued). Overriding all the existing binary operations for a ruby class to support SymEngine types, violated the open/closed principle. There was indeed another way, which is <em>‘Class Coercion’</em>. It was suggested by <a href="https://github.com/isuruf/">Isuru</a>. After that, SymEngine types could seamlessly interoperate between the ruby types.</p>

<h3 id="arithmetic-operations">Arithmetic operations</h3>
<p>After this, all the arithmetic operations had been successfully ported. Each <code>Basic</code> object can now perform arithmetic operations with other <code>Basic</code> object(sometimes even ruby objects like <code>Integer</code>). The test file in python, that had all the corresponding test cases was ported to its RSpec counterpart.</p>

<h3 id="substitutions">Substitutions</h3>
<p>Recently I completed porting the substitutions module to the extensions(<code>#subs</code>). This feature has added a lot of convenience as now you can substitute a <code>SymEngine::Symbol</code> with some other value in an expression and then <code>#expand</code> to get the result.</p>

<h3 id="trigonometric-functions">Trigonometric functions</h3>
<p>Currently, I am working on porting the trigonometric functions in SymEngine to the extensions. This would first require to wrap the <code>Function</code> class and then the <code>TrigFunction</code> class in SymEngine.</p>

<h3 id="integration-of-other-ruby-gems">Integration of other Ruby gems</h3>
<p>I also have plans to integrate the ruby bindings for <code>gmp</code>, <code>mpfr</code> and <code>mpc</code> libraries, that are already available as gems, with ruby bindings for our library. I have created an issue <a href="https://github.com/sympy/symengine/issues/490">here</a>. Feel free to drop any suggestions.</p>

<p>There is much scope for improvement in both the projects. For SymEngine, to support more features like polynomials and series-expansion in the near future, and improving the user interface and the exception handling for the extensions. In short, making the extensions more ruby-ish.</p>

<p>I hope more people will contribute to the project and we will give a nice symbolic manipulation gem to the Ruby community.</p>
