   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/KuDr42X_ITXghJhSInDZekNEF0jLt3NeVxtRye3tqco.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this term ‘docker’ while going through the project ‘Shogun-cloud’ and decided to google about it and learn what this does. Turns out it has made building, shipping and running distributed applications hassle free to a great extent.&lt;!--more--&gt; It is promising since it allows isolation of applications without the need of a different VM for each application. It is much more light-weight than a VM (anyone who has worked with a VM knows how heavy a VM can be).  The analogy given by its founder, Solomon Hykes, is very apt. He explains it as a shipping container as used by shipping companies, which standardises the shipping across each transportation vehicle regardless of what’s inside. Many companies like eBay have already changed to docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend going through this short &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/&quot;&gt;introductory video&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t involve a lot of technical terms but gives a fairly good idea about docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will be posting more as I learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
