  <em>"Writing means sharing. It's part of the human interaction to want to share things - thoughts, ideas, opinions."</em>
</p>

This blog is mainly focussed on putting down all the lessons that I learnt while programming and my journey of coding. And to make this less monotonous a few random thoughts that come to my mind, that sometimes surprise myself with their own level of creativity. I wish to keep them alive by this blog.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php), an amazing code editor.
